        <h1>Katherine Vo's Internet Page</h1>

        <p> First, the basics.</p>

        <h2>The Basics</h2>

        <p>Headings set your default page size</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <p>Let's make an unordered list.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>HTML/CSS underpins most user interfaces now</li>
            <li>CSS tries something so hard no other computer language even bothers</li>
            <li>Javascript got popular from having a runtime in every browser in the world</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And now, one in order.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Gravity by Gryffin: a dance/electronic album that has no skips; songs are upbeat</li>
            <li>Ascend by Illenium: a dance/electronic album that gets me hype; went to the concert in 2019</li>
            <li>World War Joy by The Chainsmokers: a dance/electronic album I like to play when driving</li>
            <li>beerbongs & bentleys by Post Malone: a no-skip album as well and contains hip hop, pop and R&B genres.</li>
            <li>American Teen by Khalid: a very vibey album and I loved the concert in 2017</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Inline elements</h2>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention</em> to something in a line of text.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize</strong> something in the text.</p>

        <p><em><strong>Sometimes you want to do both.</strong></em></p>

        <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
        <p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br>
            Neither can image tags, or hard lines.</p>

        <p>Add a hard line under here.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.</p>
